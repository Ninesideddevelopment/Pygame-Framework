# Pygame-Framework
My custom framework for building games in Python with Pygame! It is designed to make programming games in Pygame much easier (requires Pygame or Pygame-CE to be installed).

#Forking
If you wish to fork my repo, make sure you read the license first! The code is VERY messy in places, so you may have to pick it apart. Please don't come to me asking how it works.
